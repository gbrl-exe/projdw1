                The School of Art galleries in Green Hall provide a year-round forum for the exhibition of work by students, 
                faculty, and special guests in the four graduate departments of the School and the undergraduate program.
            </p>
            <p>
                During exhibitions, Green Hall Gallery at 1156 Chapel Street is typically open to the public but due to COVID-19, 
                it will remain open only to the School of Art and Yale communities until further notice.

                and here in sketches a path between remnants of projects and experiences—from materials and tools, 
                to audio recordings of collective and personal spaces, to the contexts in which work is encountered. 
                Artifacts will accumulate in the gallery throughout the duration of the exhibition, distilling activity to form.
