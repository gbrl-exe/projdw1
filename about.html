                THE YALE SCHOOL OF ART IS A GRADUATE SCHOOL THAT CONFERS MASTER OF FINE 
                ARTS DEGREES IN GRAPHIC DESIGN, PAINTING/PRINTMAKING, PHOTOGRAPHY, AND SCULPTURE
            </h1>
            <p>
                Artists and designers of unusual promise and strong motivation are provided an educational 
                context in which they can explore the potential of their own talents in the midst of an 
                intense critical dialogue. This dialogue is generated by their peers, by distinguished visitors, 
                and by a faculty comprised of professional artists of acknowledged accomplishment.
            </p>
            <p>
                The graduate student’s primary educational experience at Yale is centered on the student’s own 
                studio activity. Supporting this enterprise are the experience, knowledge, and skills gained from 
                rigorous, structured courses such as drawing, filmmaking, the relativity of color, and the rich 
                academic offerings found throughout Yale. Each student is routinely exposed to many aesthetic positions 
                through encounters with faculty members and visitors. The School is devoted not only to the refinement 
                of visual skills, but also to the cultivation of the mind. Students must bring creative force and 
                imagination to their own development, for these qualities cannot be taught—they can only be stimulated 
                and appreciated.
            </p>
            <p>
                The School of Art offers an undergraduate art major for students in Yale College 
                (see the bulletin Yale College Programs of Study). In addition, the School’s courses 
                are open to students in the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences and other professional 
                schools of the University, and School of Art students may enroll in elective courses in 
                the Graduate School and other professional schools as well as in the College with permission.

                MASTER OF FINE ARTS DEGREE (MFAS)
            </h1>
            <p>
                The degree of Master of Fine Arts is the only degree offered by the School of Art. 
                It is conferred by the University upon recommendation of the faculty after successful 
                completion of all course work in residence and after a thesis presentation that has been 
                approved by the faculty. It implies distinctive achievement on the part of students in studies 
                in the professional area of their choice and demonstrated capacity for independent work. 
                The minimum residence requirement is two years. All candidates’ work is reviewed by faculty 
                at the end of each term. If the work is not considered satisfactory, the student may not be 
                invited back to complete the program (see section on Review and Awards under Academic Regulations 
                in the chapter General Information). All degree candidates are expected to be present at the 
                Commencement exercises in May unless excused by the dean.
            </p>
            <p>
                Course work for the Master of Fine Arts degree carries a minimum of sixty credits. 
                The disposition of these credits varies according to the area of study and is agreed 
                upon at the time of registration between the student and the student’s faculty adviser.

                PUBLIC LECTURES AND EXHIBITIONS
            </h1>
            <p>
                Each department has its own visitors program in which professionals 
                from outside the School are invited to lecture to students or take part in critiques.
            </p>
            <p>
                The School also facilitates a public all-school lecture program, in which ideas of 
                general and cross-disciplinary importance are explored by visiting artists and members 
                of the faculty in events typically hosted in the evening that are free and open to the public.
            </p>
            <p>
                The School of Art’s galleries in Green Hall and EIK at 32 Edgewood Avenue provide a year-round 
                forum for the exhibition of work by students, faculty, and special guests in the four graduate 
                departments of the School and the undergraduate program. Green Gallery is open to the public 
                when exhibitions are scheduled, but open hours vary by semester. EIK is open during limited hours 
                for specific exhibitions and events. Please refer to the Gallery & Publications page for more information.
